RFID handbook
=============

Types of IDs
------------

1. Barcodes.
2. OCR, _optical character recognition_.
2. Biometric:
	- Voice ID.
	- Fingerprint, some systems have even developed technologies that detect if the ID is from a living person.
3. Smart cards. Are the old telephone cards or the chip on a regular credit card. They are connected by contact springs and feed power to input and subtract information.
	- Memory cards.
	- Microprocessor cards.
4. RFID systems. Are a type of smart cards that add the functionality of wireless transmission of data.

Sections of an RFID system
--------------------------

- Transponder, i.e. the object to be identified.
	- Coupling element, coil or antenna.
	- Chip, transponder, receivess power and clock from the reader.
- Reader or interrogator, which may be a _reader_ or a _write/read_ device. In general, the name 'reader' is assigned regardless of writing capabilities.

Different features of RFID systems
----------------------------------

There are two main differentiation criteria:

- Full duplex (FDX) / half duplex (HDX). The response of the transponder is broadcast when the reader RF field is switched on due to the low energy available, in FDX and HDX . The data transfer from transponder to reader takes place using load modulation (a type of modulation that uses a subcarrier of 1/16 in order to retransmit information).
- Sequential systems (SEQ). The field from the reader is switched off at regular intervals. The energy from the reader must be stored in capacitors or batteries in order to send the response.

Data capabilities of RFID transponders range from a few bytes to several kilobytes except for 1-bit transponders. A data quantity of exactly 1 bit is enough to signal 2 states to the reader: existence or absence of the tag. These types of transponders are widely use given the low price at which they can be manufactured (Clothing tags).
